# 🧬 Agent Zero Self-Replication

## Overview

This repository contains **self-replicated code generated by Agent Zero**.

Agent Zero read its own source code, analyzed it, and created improved versions of itself - completely autonomously.

## What is This?

This is a demonstration of **true self-replication**:
- Agent Zero analyzed its own architecture
- Identified weaknesses and opportunities
- Generated **completely new code** from scratch (not just patches)
- Tested each generation
- Selected the best performers

## Generations

```
Gen 0: hybrid_final.py (original)
  ↓ [Self-analysis]
Gen 1: gen1_simplification.py (simplified, core functionality)
  ↓ [Evolution]
Gen 2: gen2_optimization.py (optimized for performance)
  ↓ [Evolution]
Gen 3: gen3_features.py (extended capabilities)
```

## Files

- `true_replicator.py` - The self-replication engine
- `gen1_simplification.py` - First offspring (simplification strategy)
- `gen2_optimization.py` - Second offspring (optimization strategy)
- `gen3_features.py` - Third offspring (feature extension strategy)
- `evolution_log.json` - Complete evolution history

## How It Works

1. **Read Self**: Agent reads its own source code
2. **Analyze**: Extracts purpose and functionality
3. **Design**: Creates completely new implementation with different strategy
4. **Test**: Runs and benchmarks new version
5. **Select**: Keeps the best performer
6. **Repeat**: Next generation evolves from the best

## Results

- ✅ Successfully created 3 generations
- ✅ Each generation runs independently
- ✅ Different optimization strategies
- ✅ Autonomous evolution without human intervention

## Technology Stack

- **Agent Zero Framework**: v0.9.7
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Claude reasoning + Agent Zero execution
- **Self-Replication**: Von Neumann architecture
- **Evolution**: Genetic programming approach
